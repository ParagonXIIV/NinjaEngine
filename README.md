# NinjaEngine
A Game Engine that runs Ninja Gaiden Black from the original Xbox on pc.


# What is this?

    This is a game engine dedicated to run ninja gaiden black on pc.
    Yes I decided to keep going on the project as of now.


# What do I need to use this software?

    You will need a pc running windows 64bit and 
    your pwn physical copy of ninja gaiden black.


# How do I install this?

    Extract the release zip file from github
    to your desktop and inside there will be a 
    exe and some other files and subfolders.

    Next you need to create a iso of ninja gaiden black
    from your own physical copy. Then dump the iso to your
    desktop in seperate folder. Then inside there will be several
    files also containing a .xbe xbox executable file. Copy all these 
    files and put them inside the subfolder called game inside your release build
    folder that you extracted from the beginning of this tutorial.
    Then launch the game and you are good to go.


 # Will this software run or work without the ninja gaiden black game data?


    No It will not you are required to obtain these game data files I cannot
    provide these files. The software is useless without the game data files.
    Sorry!
